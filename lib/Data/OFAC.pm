=head1 NAME

Data::OFAC - A Perl interface to the United States Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.52

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.52';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    From OFAC's Website:
        As part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of
        individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on
        behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and
        entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers designated under
        programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals
        and companies are called "Specially Designated Nationals" or "SDNs."
        Their assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from
        dealing with them.

    This interface is helpful for insitutions that use Perl, and may have a
    need to screen individuals as potential customers.

    Note that this module will require occasional internet access if
    auto_update is enabled. Auto update contacts OFAC's website to download
    the latest SDN list in "CSV" format. These files are used to build a SQLite
    database. In order to remain "compliant" reasonably frequent updates are
    recommended. For financial institutions, not complying with this carries
    heavy penalties. I am not a lawyer, and I cannot recommend your update
    frequency. I've set 12 hours as I believe this to be a reasonable update
    interval. Again, this module carries no waranty, and cannot be a full
    replacement for full compliance with the regulations. YMMV.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    A simple example.

    use Data::OFAC;

    my $ofac = Data::OFAC->new(
        auto_update => 1,
        auto_update_frequency => 12,
        database_file => '/path/to/sdn.sqlite'
    );

    my $result = $ofac->checkString($string);

    if ( defined $result ) {
        print "Hit found:" .
            Dumper $result; # varries by hit, but is just a hash.
    }
    ...

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

    Instantiates the base object. Note that the following parameters are
    currently supported:

=head3 auto_update [0,1] (Optional)

    Tells Data::OFAC whether you desire to update the database. It will check a
    table in SQLite to determine the last update date/time and decide if
    checking for a new update is warranted. Note that the download is not
    particularly large, but the download and subsequent rebuild of the database
    could introduce a startup penalty that may be undesirable. (30 seconds on my
    quad core MBP) For long running processes, there is no present method for
    updating on the fly. Since I run this as part of a larger web service, my
    processes cycle frequently enough that I never have this problem. YMMV

    0 - disable
    1 - enable *default

=head3 auto_update_frequency [int] (Optional)

    Sets the desired delay between rechecks. Data::OFAC will recheck at each
    start if the auto_update property is set to 1.

    Default: 12 (hours)

=head3 database_file [string] (Optional)

    Sets the desired location to keep the database file. The default is your
    home directory in the ".ofac" directory.

    Default: $ENV{HOME}/.ofac/sdn.sqlite or $ENV{USERPROFILE}\.ofac\sdn.sqlite

=head2 checkString

Checks the specified string against all fields.

my $result = $ofac->checkString("String");

=cut

    $resultset->{Address} = $self->{sdn}->search('Address', $string, @columns);

    return $resultset;
}

=head2 checkAddress

Checks the specified array against the address table. Note the Country must be
spelled out I.E. Nigeria

my $result =
   $ofac->checkAddress("City, State, Province, Postal Code", "Country");

=cut

sub checkAddress {
    my $self = shift;
    my $address = shift;
    my $country = shift;

    return $self->{sdn}->searchAddress($address, $country);
}

=head2 checkName

Checks the specified name against the SDN and ALT tables. Note that for the
best match, supply an individual's name in "Lastname, Firstname" format. For
corporations, supply in regular format.

=cut

sub checkName {
    my $self = shift;
    my $name = shift;

    my $resultset;

    my @columns = qw{sdn_name title};

    for ( qw {Sdn SdnComment} ) {

        $resultset->{$_} = $self->{sdn}->search($_, $name, @columns);

    }

    @columns = qw{alt_name};

    $resultset->{Alt} = $self->{sdn}->search('Alt', $name, @columns);
